To play around with pyagme a little, I implemented this game of Kalah.  I like to extend it by adding options for different rules, as well as better graphics, a better interface in general, some form of tutorial and the option to play against an AI.

I've added a tutorial and a menu. I've also heavily restructured the code. I've included the python files for the popup menu library I am using (which can also be found at code.google.com/p/simple-pygame-menu/).
